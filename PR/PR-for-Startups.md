# PR for Startups: The 10 Step Process I Use to Get Press

Source: https://www.criminallyprolific.com/pr-for-startups/

## 1. Nail Your One Sentence Value Prop

A value prop is what you do that sets you apart from competing products. You should be able to answer what you do in 1 sentence. 

>My Company {name} is developing {offering} to help {target audience} {solve a problem} with {a secret sauce}.

Pitch with the following questions:
- **S**imple - can it be pitched in the subject line?
- **U**nexpected - You've got my attention, now can you keep it?
- **C**oncrete - Can you express this in terms that I understand?
- **C**redible - Why are *you* telling me this story?
- **E**motional - Why does this matter to my audience?
- **S**tories - What's the narrative? How's it flow?

A great story sticks in someone’s memory much longer than generic explanations of what you do.

The longer you can stay sloshing around in a journalist’s brain, the better the chance they will remember you when they plan to write a story about a related topic. 

Master storytelling and doing PR for startups will come naturally to you.

## 2. Create a Contact List of Relevant Journalists

In this step, you have to find reporters whose main beats include what your product/app/service does.

What space is your company in?

Use the following formula:

**(descriptor) + (noun)**

*Noun:* Think about the main action your service/product facilitates or performs. Is it sharing? Is it delivery? Or is it coworking?
*Descriptor:* What is its one main distinguishing feature.

**Examples:**

*Product:* car sharing app

*Space:* peer sharing

*Product:* travel concierge service

*Space:* personalized travel

You should know the space you are in so we won’t spend too much time discussing how to identify that. 
Go ahead and type in the space your company is in into Google and toggle to the News tab.

Why Google News tab? Because the people who recently wrote stories about your industry/space are most likely interested in what you do.
Alternatively, you can type in the name of one of your competitors.

At this point, you should have a list of articles written about your keyword, your space, your industry, your competitors. Add the links to these articles into a Google Spreadsheet.

In the spreadsheet make sure you have the following columns:

- Full name of the reporter
- Date of the article
- Link to the article
- Link to the Twitter profile for the reporter
- Any link to the personal website or blog of the reporter (if available)
- Details
- Category

**This will be your *ground zero* when building media relations.**

Fill out the spreadsheet with the details by researching every article and the person who wrote that article.

When going through each article, click through to the journalist’s social media profile. Only if they cover your field on a regular basis (you see multiple articles written by them on this topic in the last month or two) go ahead and add them to your spreadsheet.

Keep in mind there are different types of media outlets and blogs, so you want to make sure you categorize each publication in your Google doc.

Here’s the hierarchy of publications and blogs from most authoritative and thus toughest to break into to the least

![hierarchy of publications and blogs](http://www.criminallyprolific.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image00.png)

As you can see, at the very top of the press pyramid are mainstream media companies. Further down are industry and mid-tier blogs. At the bottom are personal blogs.

It is useful to categorize the reporters and media companies in your hit list so you know how hard it would be to reach them.

## 3. Find Email Addresses of Journalists

Finding emails these days is super easy.

The first thing to do is Google for your target’s name, use queries like:

- firstName lastName + email
- firstName lastName + contact
- (PersonalWebsiteURL) + email
- site:(domain.com): “firstName lastName”

This is the easiest way but may not yield great results.

So we move to the next step which is to guess the email pattern used on a company domain.

Most emails are in the following formats:

- firstname@company.com
- firstnamelastname@company.com
- firstinitiallast@company.com

For instance, if you wanted to get in touch with John Smith at Tim Hortons, you could try using an email like JSmith@timhortons.com.

Search for the publication on www.email-format.com to find out which format the journalist’s email is most likely in.

However, this isn’t always foolproof.

To confirm whether you have guessed the right email address use these free tools:

- www.verifyemailaddress.org
- www.verify-email.org/

If you have a personal website for the journalist, pop it into WHOIS. In most cases, it returns the personal email address of the site owner.

An email sent to their personal email address has a much higher open rate than one that is sent to their business address where it has to fight for attention amongst the hundred other pitches that flood their work inboxes. 

**This can be a big advantage when you’re learning how to build a PR strategy for small businesses.**

## 4. Connect and Network with Journalists

You know how sometimes you go to a website and suddenly an ad for it follows you everywhere? In the ad world, that’s called retargeting. And the repeated exposure works by subtly worming the company’s way into your subconscious. Well, there’s a way you can do that with journalists who have previously never heard of you.

1. Follow the journalists you want to pitch on Twitter from your personal account.

2. If they ask any questions or share an article, leave a meaningful response that relays one of your personal experiences or an interesting piece of knowledge. Don’t forget to inject some personality and humor into it to really stand out!

3. If any articles they share is also relevant to your audience, retweet it. Add this tactic to your to-do list so that you remember to do it regularly.

Following journalists on Twitter and other social media platforms like Instagram also gives you a better idea of their writing style and personality so you can tailor your choice of wording accordingly.

Ideally, you should be laying the groundwork for outreach to influencers and journalists while you’re building your company. This way when launch day comes, you have all your ducks lined in a row.

What journalists like receiving without any strings attached:

- Substantive answers to questions they pose on social media/their blog
- Inside scoops about something related to their beat that is going to happen
- Valuable help (example: if they are traveling somewhere, throw together a brief guide for them about the best places to eat/see)

## 5. Write a Banging Email Pitch

Why and how to do PR for startups over email? Why not Twitter, LinkedIn or Facebook?

Growthhackers.com shared a kick-ass study Fractl conducted of 500+ journalists from top sites like BuzzFeed, TIME, Lifehacker, Scientific American, TechCrunch and more about what they want in a pitch.

Here are some key findings:

- 81% of journalists prefer pitches over email
- Most writers publish one story per day, 44% of them get pitched a minimum of 20 times a day.
- 39% are looking for exclusive research to publish
- 64% said it was moderately to very important to establish a personal connection before pitching
- 69% prefer a pitch in the morning

Think of an angle you can present your company from or a context you can place your company or brand in.

*Company:* Car sharing app
*Angle:* People are much more comfortable about sharing items with strangers these days
*Context:* Sharing economy

Most journalists don’t just write pieces about your company and what it does. That’s called…an ad. What they will do is use your company as the jumping off point into a story about the space you operate in or what implications your product/service has for your audience and society at large.

## Email Pitch Templates Which I Like to Use

### Template 1: If your company does work in an exciting space which has been in the news lately

Subject: Re: [The title of their related article from your contact list]

Hey X-

My name is [first name] from [company name]. After reading your article [story.title] I thought your readers might be interested to hear more about [topic from their article which relates to what you’re pitching] since the subject of [general topic from the article] has been in the news lately. Looking over your past articles, it seems you cover [topic from the article] a lot.

We have some [insert your news/study] which relate directly to your interests. I wanted to send you some info on this topic. Would you be interested?

Thanks,

Your full name

Contact details

### Template 2: If your company makes a product that can be used in articles or websites

Subject: Got a poll for you: Which Foursquare logo do you prefer?

Hey Chris-

Made a poll for your article asking which Foursquare logo people like the best. Check it, might be fun to get your readers more involved and get more readers to come back to the article: http://polarb.com/polls/194407

Here are how these polls look like live: http://guycodeblog.mtv.com/2014/03/21/vote-favorite-melanie-iglesias-photos/

### Template 3: The personal angle pitch

Subject: Got a good story for your article about the extremes entrepreneurs go (involves not showering much)

Hey X-

Saw on Twitter you’re writing an article about the extremes entrepreneurs go to bootstrap their startups.

I’ve got a good one for you. I actually slept in my car while I ran around pitching investors.

My gamble (and slightly less frequent showers!) paid off. I secured a $100K lifeline, giving my company enough runway to takeoff.

Happy to provide a few solid insights about how to decide if a big sacrifice like this is worth it.

If interested, I can provide the rest of the details,

Thank you.

### Template 4: The innovative product angle

Subject: [Just launched] Our software tracks serial killers

Hey Journalist,

Really trust you as the go-to source of nuanced explanations of recent STEM breakthroughs. Liked your recent article on the potential of Theranos to revolutionize blood tests without short shifting the skepticism surrounding its proprietary tests.

I’ve got another interesting breakthrough for you to chew on. I recently created an algorithm that helps police narrow down where repeat offenders live by calculating distances between the locations of their crimes. My software Rigel assigns the highest probability percentages to areas where the serial killer is most likely to live or hang out in.

Police have used Rigel to help catch serial killers including:

the Suffolk strangler
the M25 rapist
Pickton
Exciting new applications I’m exploring:

Tracking illegal immigration patterns
Will this be a good fit for your audience? Let me know if you would be interested in more details.

### Template 6: The interesting data angle

Subject: Juicy data about racial bias in dating preferences – interested?

Hey X,

Been following your articles for a while, great insights into social trends.

Your recent article about rising reports of people feeling lonely really resonated with me. I think with the declining popularity of several institutions like the Church that traditionally provided opportunities for people to regular meet; there haven’t been many replacements that have brought people together in the same way.

I also have a few juicy social trends to share with you. Our whizzes at OkCupids have been busy crunching some numbers and our data paints a pretty sobering portrait of racial bias in online dating.

The highlights:

Black women receive the lowest number of messages
Asian and black men receive fewer messages than white men
Most races still prefer to date within their race
Some interesting questions this poses:

Are these patterns played out in real life dating choices?
Or are online daters, who can ‘window shop’ a lot more options, more selective?
Think this will be a good fit for your audience? Find attached an overview of the report.

### Template 7: Interesting context angle

Subject: How our product plans to replace food

Hey Journalist,

I’ve been following your articles for a while – very cutting cultural analyses. Loved your recent one about eating insects as a substitute for meat protein – think all it needs is an image makeover to overcome the ick factor.

Wanted you to introduce you to another food substitute we recently launched – in the form of a nutritional drink. It provides 2600 healthy calories a day and makes eating super affordable and convenient. Step 1: blend with water or milk. Step 2: Drink up and feel full.

For the average four-member American family: $154.62 per month on Soylent versus $584 on groceries.

Interesting angle to explore: Soylent’s role in the life-hacking movement.

If this is a good fit, let me know.

### Template 8: The local angle

Hey Journalist,

Really interesting coverage about the lax security at VIP lounges. It’s that old truism – money talks.

Thought you might be interested in something my team and I just launched. Ever been stuck at work and you’ve just dying to eat your favorite chipotle taco? But snag, they don’t deliver? Well, imagine a world where every restaurant, even your favorite hole in the wall that can barely keep up with the crush, does deliver. We’re making it happen! With our team of meal heroes on scooters.

Basically, you call the restaurant to order and then call us to arrange the pickup and delivery: [link]

Let me know if this is a good fit for your audience? We can throw in an exclusive coupon for them – first delivery free. And suddenly a few more people just became the employee of the month at their workplace. 🙂

## Relationship building emails

These emails are primarily for building a connection with a journalist. Once you have a connection, you’ll find that they are more likely to at least open your email and consider it.

### Template 1: Giving the journalist a scoop

Hey name #1-

Respect your writing a bunch, I’m an old acquaintance of [insert name #2] of [publication for which name #1 writes for], love your blog and tend to check it every other day. Saw something you’d dig, wanted to pass it on… in relation to your post on webcams from Feb:

## 6. Track your Email Pitches

There are several tools to track your emails to see if the journalist has read your email or clicked on your link. My favorite is MixMax for Gmail. It works like a charm and the free plan includes unlimited email tracking!

I can set the default setting to track all the emails I sent out. Or I can select the individual emails I prefer to track

Email tracking is extremely useful when doing PR for startups. I can then just search for email or go to my sent folder to see if anybody has opened it or read it. The lightning icon with a number next to it indicates someone has opened it and the number of times they opened it.

Some other good alternatives are YesWare and Sidekick.

## 7. Improve your Pitches based on Open and Response Rates

You should start by pitching to lower traffic publications to perfect your pitch first. 

Continually tweak the following parts of your email:

- your subject line
- how you describe your differentiating factor
- the angle you pitch from

Tweak the email until you consistently start to get over 2 email opens from a single email pitch (it goes without saying that you should only send one pitch to each reporter).

## 8. Follow up with the Journalists

I’d say 90% of responses I get from journalists are to follow up emails I send.

This is the most important step in a PR program and should be part of your core press strategy.

Some journalists who are intrigued by your pitch may not act immediately. You must follow up! Check your email tracking logs. If a recipient opens your email 2-3 times, it generally means they have some interest in your pitch. In this case, send them a follow-up email 3-4 days after your initial one. Say something simple like:

“Hey

We just did [recent interesting development].

Let me know your thoughts about [our company]?”

## 9. Prepare your Site for Media Coverage

If you get coverage, depending on the media outlet, prepare your site for a deluge of traffic. If you have hired an agency to handle your site give them a heads up.

1. Make sure your site is hosted on a dedicated server or a cloud hosting service.
2. Use Cloudflare. Add a line of script to your site and it automatically minifies your javascript files and caches your files so your site loads a lot faster.
3. Email your host. This is one step that a lot of people don’t take. If you’re about to get hit with some serious traffic, shoot an email to your web hosts and see if they can help you at all by allotting your site more resources.
4. Minify your images. Minify all your images to its lowest possible size without severely impacting quality.

When one media outlet covers you, it not only gives you a lot of social proof but helps you be discovered by other journalists as well, kicking off a snowball effect (hopefully). Make sure you have your contact info prominently displayed on your front page so other people can easily email you.

## 10. Perfect your Landing Page

Nothing worse than getting lots of press mentions and getting that dreaded 99% bounce rate. 
Get Optimizely to A/B test your landing pages to see which copy is more effective at getting your audience to take the desired action.

Also, your design approach strategy should be to stick to a “one page, one conversion goal.”  

As in, your landing page should focus primarily on guiding your visitors to perform one action – whether it be downloading your app, signing up for a trial or leaving their email. One action.
