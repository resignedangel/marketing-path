## The Key Principles to building a growth model:

- It should be simple and easy to explain your growth model to your company employees, your board of directors, and to people outside of your company.
- “Growth” is more than the acquisition channels, growth hacks, and growth tactics you use.
- Growth in the broadest sense is about understanding your company’s specific levers of growth and building an organization around this model.

## The Foundational Growth Model

- A) Top of the funnel — the various mechanisms where you can drive traffic and conversions to your product (SEO, Paid Acquisition, SEM, Social, etc)
- B) Magic Moment — the one compelling experience that creates an initial emotional response that your customers or users first experience when using your product.
- C) Core Product Value — the problem your product is solving for its customers — Is it important to the customer and is there a sizable market behind this problem?

The goal should be to understand your growth model and your levers of growth before jumping into tactics.

Most growth professionals come into a new company and start working on A) the top of the funnel right away. The problem with this is if you don't really understand B) and C) then you are fundamentally adding people into a leaky bucket. You can’t growth hack your way out of a crappy product. In simple terms, you can’t sustainably grow something that sucks.
