# This is Marketing

- Marketing seeks more. More market share, more customers, more work. 
- Marketing is driven by better. Better service, better community, better outcomes. 
- Marketing creates culture. Status, affiliation, and people like us. 
- Most of all, marketing is change. 
- Change the culture, change your world. 
- Marketers make change happen. 
- Each of us is a marketer, and each of us has the ability to make more change than we imagined. Our opportunity and our obligation is to do marketing that we’re proud of.

# Chapter 1. Not Mass, Not Spam, Not Shameful...
## The lock and the key
It doesn’t make any sense to make a key and then run around looking for a lock to open. The only productive solution is to find a lock and then fashion a key. It’s easier to make products and services for the customers you seek to serve than it is to find customers for your products and services.

## It’s time 
- Time to get off the social media merry-go-round that goes faster and faster but never gets anywhere. 
- Time to stop hustling and interrupting. 
- Time to stop spamming and pretending you’re welcome. 
- Time to stop making average stuff for average people while hoping you can charge more than a commodity price. 
- Time to stop begging people to become your clients, and time to stop feeling bad about charging for your work. 
- Time to stop looking for shortcuts, and time to start insisting on a long, viable path instead.

# Chapter 2. The Marketer Learns to See.
## Marketing in five steps
1. The first step is to invent a thing worth making, with a story worth telling, and a contribution worth talking about.
2. The second step is to design and build it in a way that a few people will particularly benefit from and care about.
3. The third step is to tell a story that matches the built-in narrative and dreams of that tiny group of people, the smallest viable market.
4. The fourth step is the one everyone gets excited about: spread the word.
5. The last step is often overlooked: show up—regularly, consistently, and generously, for years and years—to organize and lead and build confidence in the change you seek to make. To earn permission to follow up and to earn enrollment to teach.

## This Is Marketing: An executive summary 

- Ideas that spread, win. 
- Marketers make change happen: for the smallest viable market, and by delivering anticipated, personal, and relevant messages that people actually want to get. 
- Marketers don’t use consumers to solve their company’s problem; they use marketing to solve other people’s problems. They have the empathy to know that those they seek to serve don’t want what the marketer wants, don’t believe what they believe, and don’t care about what they care about. They probably never will. 
- At the heart of our culture is our belief in status, in our self-perceived understanding of our role in any interaction, in where we’re going next. 
- We use status roles and our decisions about affiliation and dominion to decide where to go and how to get there. 
- Persistent, consistent, and frequent stories, delivered to an aligned audience, will earn attention, trust, and action. 
- Direct marketing is not the same as brand marketing, but they are both based on our decision to make the right thing for the right people. 
- “People like us do things like this” is how each of us understands culture, and marketers engage with this idea every day. Ideas move through a slope. They skate through the early adopters, leap through a chasm, and slog their way to the masses. Sometimes. 
- Attention is a precious resource since our brains are cluttered with noise. Smart marketers make it easy for those they seek to work with, by helping position the offering in a way that resonates and is memorable. 
- Most of all, marketing begins (and often ends) with what we do and how we do it, not in all the stuff that comes after the thing is designed and shipped. 
- Your tactics can make a difference, but your strategy—your commitment to a way of being and a story to be told and a promise to be made—can change everything. 
- If you want to make change, begin by making culture. Begin by organizing a tightly knit group. Begin by getting people in sync.
- Culture beats strategy—so much that culture is strategy.

## Things marketers know

1. Committed, creative people can change the world (in fact, they’re the only ones who do). You can do it right now, and you can make more change than you can possibly imagine. 
2. You cannot change everyone; therefore, asking, “Who’s it for?” can focus your actions and help you deal with the nonbelievers (in your head and in the outside world). 
3. Change is best made with intent. “What’s it for?” is the posture of work that matters. 
4. Human beings tell themselves stories. Those stories, as far as each of us is concerned, are completely and totally true, and it’s foolish to try to persuade them (or us) otherwise.
5. We can group people into stereotyped groups that often (but not always) tell themselves similar stories, groups that make similar decisions based on their perceived status and other needs. 
6. What you say isn’t nearly as important as what others say about you.
