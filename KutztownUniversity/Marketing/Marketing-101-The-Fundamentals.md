# What is Marketing?

## What is Marketing?

- Most people mistakenly identify marketing with selling and promotion
- While selling and promotion are part of marketing, they are not most important part
- In **Principles of Marketing** Philip Kotler stated: *"If the marketer does a good job of identifying consumer needs, developing appropriate products, and pricing, distributing, and promoting them effectively, these goods will sell very easily."*

## Defining Marketing...

- Marketing can be defined as an activity directed at satisfying needs and wants through exchange processes.
- The ultimate goal of marketing is to make selling nonessential
- To know and understand the customer so well that the product or service fis him or her and sells itself

## Needs, Wants, and Demands

- One of the underlying concepts of marketing is trying to satisfy a customer's needs, wants and demands
- Needs are plentiful. Basic human needs include food, clothing, warmth, safety and belonging.
- Wants are simply needs shaped by culture and the individual
- Demands are simply the wants of a consumer when backed by the ability to pay for that want

## Dynamic marketing environment

- There are many forces that affect marketing environment, including:
   1. Competition
   2. Laws and Regulations
   3. Economic and Social Conditions
   4. Cultural Factors
- These forces can be dramatic and difficult to predict
- Be aware of these forces because they can create threats and generate opprtunities for your business

## The marketing mix

- The marketing mix is another important concept when it comes to marketing
- The marketing mix refers to ativities that a firm can control to produce the response it wants from the target market
- These variables can be categorized into 4 groups, also known as 4 P's of marketing

## The 4 P's of marketing

1. Product - This is what you are offering to your target market, be it a tangible product or a service.
2. Price - The amount you will charge for your product.
3. Place - Channels your product will go through to reach the customer.
4. Promotion - How you raise awareness with your target market.

## The 5th P of marketing

- While the previous four P’s are important to the marketing mix, there is one that is left out.
- Positioning
- Positioning is not dealing with where you will place your product in the market, but where you will place your product in the mind of the consumer.

# Conducting Market Research

## Marketing research data

- There are two main types of data that will help you in researching your market.
- The first is **secondary data.**  Secondary data is information that already exists somewhere.  It was collected for another purpose.
- **Primary data,** consists of information collected for the specific purpose at hand.

## Start with secondary data

- Researchers will usually start by collecting secondary data.
- Secondary data can be obtained quicker and at lower costs.
- When collecting secondary data evaluate it carefully to make sure that it is:
   1. Relevant
   2. Accurate
   3. Current
   4. Impartial
   
## Researching your industry

- With all the resource outlets that exist today, there are many opportunities for you to gather secondary information on the industry you will be participating in.
- The following sources should help you in getting started:
   1. NAICS Code 
   2. Hoovers
   3. Standard & Poor’s 
   4. Trade Associations

## Researching your customer

Before you start researching your customer, it is important that you determine whether they will be individuals in a particular area or if they will be other businesses.

## Researching consumers

There are many secondary data sources for researching consumers.
- Consumer expenditure surveys
- Census data
- Demographics
- Psycho-graphics
   1. VALS – (Values, Attitudes, & Lifestyles Surveys)
   2. Zip code psychographics

## Researching businesses

If your target customers are other businesses, the following links may be helpful in conducting research:
- Business expenditure survey
- Economic census
- IRS data

## Estimating your market size

- After you have determined who your customer will be and found some of their characteristics,
- You need to estimate the size of your target market.
- IRS, Census, RMA, and Dun & Bradstreet are all sources that can help you estimate your target market size.

## Collecting primary data

- Since primary data does not already exist it can become very costly and time consuming to gather.
- There are several ways to collect primary data.
- The most common methods are observation, survey, and experiment.
- These methods can be done by mailings, telephone calls, and personal interactions to name a few.

## The three research approaches

- Data is gathered in the observational approach by watching people in either a natural or artificial setting.
- The survey approach is best suited for those who are looking to gather descriptive information.
- The experimental approach involves selecting two groups, giving them different treatments, and then measuring the effects.

## Contacting research subjects

- With mail questionnaires you can collect a fairly large amount of information at a low cost.
- Telephone interviewing costs more than mail questionnaires but can provide more information quickly.
- Individual interviewing is another way of gathering information.  This type of interviewing may require an incentive to get people to participate.
- Gathering a group of people together to discuss certain topics with a trained interviewer is known as group interviewing.

## The anatomy of a questionnaire

When developing a questionnaire keep the following in mind:

- Take your time to make sure that it is carefully developed and tested.
- Carefully choose your wording of each question.
- The sequence of the questions is also important
- Make sure that all the questions included in the survey are necessary.

## Interpreting market research

- Interpreting data can easily become overwhelming if you are not careful
- Make sure that you report only major findings.
- Do not use too many statistical analyses just for the sake of using them.
- Put your findings into simple terms so that even someone not familiar with the survey will be able to understand them.

# Analyzing The Market Environment

## Macro and micro environments

- The marketing environment is made up of two environments;
- The **microenvironment** is the immediate environment that effects the companies ability to serve customers.
- The **macroenvironment** consists of larger social forces that affect all players in the microenvironment.

## Analyzing your company

- All groups in a company - Accounting, R&D, Manufacturing, Top Management – are part of a company’s microenvironment.
- All these departments will have an impact on the marketing decisions and actions of the company.
- For this reason, the marketing manager should try to work closely with these departments and others when establishing a marketing plan.

## Distribution channels

- Distribution channels will also play a role in the microenvironment
- Suppliers, middlemen, warehouses and transporters are just a few of the factors that will effect the business.
- Be aware of these factors and how they will affect your market planning and decisions.

## Analyzing your customers

- Which customer market will the company operate in?
   1. Consumer
   2. Industrial
   3. Reseller
   4. Government
   5. International
- Each of these markets’ characteristics should be analyzed on how they will effect the company.

## Competitive forces

- The number of firms that supply a similar product will play a role in the competitive environment.
- Once you determine the number of competitors, you should then analyze competitive tools that will set you apart from the competition or give the competition an advantage over you.
- The first competitive tool most companies will use is price.

## Monitoring competition

- Be aware of the actions of your competitors.
- Also develop an understanding of the market you are participating in,
- and what the customers in this market want.

## SEPTE analysis

- A SEPTE analysis is a process that helps in analyzing the macroenvironment.
- SEPTE stands for:
   1. Social environment
   2. Economic environment
   3. Political and legal environment
   4. Technological environment
   5. Environmental issues

## Social environment

- Social environmental factors include demographics and cultural aspects. 
- These factors affect customer needs and the size of potential markets.
- Some social factors include:
   1. population growth rates
   2. population shifts
   3. age structure (youths, young adults, retirees, etc.)
   4. the changing in family structure 
   
## Economic environment

- Economic trends can affect the marketing environment in several ways.
- Fluctuations in real income determine how much consumers will have to spend on discretionary goods and services.
- Also take into account the income distribution and the average income of your target market.

## Other economic factors

- Other economic factors include income, cost of living, interest rates, and savings and borrowing patterns.
- These factors can have a substantial impact on the marketplace.

## Political and legal environment

- Developments in the political and legal environment can have serious consequences on your marketing efforts.
- Be aware of:
   1. Legislation regulating business
   2. The affects of government agencies such as the FDA, FCC, or EPA on your company.
   3. Growth of public interest groups that positively or negatively affect your business.

## Technological environment

- Technological factors can lower barriers to entry and influence outsourcing decisions.
- Some examples of technological factors include R&D activity, automation and rate of technological change.
- Another factor that may affect the technological environment is if a company concentrates only on minor improvements or major innovations

## Environmental issues

- In our ever changing world, marketers should pay close attention to certain environmental factors that could create tremendous impacts on the marketplace.
- Impending shortages on raw materials, increased cost of energy, increased levels of pollution, and government regulations and intervention all play a role in the environmental marketplace.

# Selecting Your Target Markets

## Consumer vs. Business

- The first step in selecting your target market is to determine whether your customers are consumers or businesses and industries.
- Keep in mind that you can have more than one target market.  However, if you find the description of your market too broad or general, then ask yourself:
- Is there really more than one target market here?

## Geographic location

- Next consider the geographic level you will target.
- Will your customers be mostly at the local, state, national or international level?
- You also need to decide what the geographic makeup of your target market will be.
- You can classify your target market as either rural, suburban, urban, or a mix of any of these.

## Demographic variables

- What characteristics will your target market share that will differentiate them from others?
- These variables should be measurable and can include any of the following:
   1. Age
   2. Gender
   3. Race
   4. Ethnicity
   5. Income	
   6. Education
   7. Occupation
   8. Family Size
   9. Marital Status
   10. Social Class
   
## Demographic resources

Many resources are available to help you define the demographics of your target market.

- U.S. Census Bureau
- Consumer Spending Surveys
- Business Expense Surveys
- American Factfinder
- State and County Quick Facts
- EasiDemographics

## Psychographics of your market

- Psychographics help define characteristics of a group based on their lifestyle, personality, and social class.
- One of the most popular surveys of psychographics is known as the VALS.
- Value, Attitude, Lifestyle Surveys

## VALS

- VALS place consumers into certain segments based on their responses to a particular survey.
- There are eight segments that they may be placed into.
- These segments are then defined by certain characteristics and traits that they share.
- For more information go to:
   1. http://www.sric-bi.com/VALS/

## Zip code psychographics

- People with similar lifestyles tend to live in the vicinity of one another.
- Zip code psychographics can help you define characteristics of a region by just knowing its zip code
- For more information go to: http://www.claritas.com/MyBestSegments/Default.jsp 

## Selecting your target market

- To recap, when selecting your target market it is easiest to start broad and then move to more narrow to define your market.
   1. Are you targeting consumers or a business/industry?
   2. What is the geographic makeup of your target market?
   3. What are the demographics of your target market?
   4. What are the psychographics of your target market?

# Market Positioning

## The concept of positioning

- One of the best-known names in American advertising circles is David Ogilvy.
- After spending several billion dollars on advertising, Ogilvy listed 32 things his ad agency had learned.
- Of the thirty-two, he said that the single most important decision involved positioning the product.
- He claimed that marketing results depended less on how advertising was written than how the product or service was positioned.

## The origins of positioning

- In their 1981 book, Positioning: The Battle for your Mind, Al Ries and Jack Trout describe how positioning is used as a communication tool to reach target customers in a crowded marketplace.
- Not long thereafter, Madison Avenue advertising executives began to develop positioning slogans for their clients and positioning became a key aspect of marketing communications.
- While positioning begins with a product, the concept really is about positioning that product in the mind of the customer.  In other words, marketing is a battle of perception, not products. 

## What is positioning?

- Ries and Trout explain that the concept is really about positioning a product in the mind of the customer.  Strategy is therefore planned in the mind, not the marketplace. 
- This approach is needed because consumers are bombarded with a continuous stream of high-volume advertising.
- The consumer's mind reacts to this high volume of advertising by accepting only what is consistent with prior knowledge or experience.

## How positioning works

- It is quite difficult to change a consumer's impression once it is formed.
- Consumers cope with information overload by oversimplifying and are likely to shut out anything inconsistent with their knowledge and experience.
- In an over-communicated environment, the advertiser should present a simplified message and make that message consistent with what the consumer already believes by focusing on the perceptions of the consumer rather than on the reality of the product.

## The importance of being first

- The easiest way of getting into someone's mind is to be first.
- It is very easy to remember who is first, and much more difficult to remember who is second. Even if the second entrant offers a better product, the first mover has a large advantage that can make up for other shortcomings.
- However, all is not lost for products that are not the first. By being the first to claim a unique position in the mind of the consumer, a firm effectively can cut through the noise level of other products.

## A few positioning examples

- Miller Lite was not the first light beer, but it was the first to be positioned as a light beer, complete with a name to support that position.
- Similarly, Lowenbrau was the most popular German beer sold in America, but Beck's Beer successfully carved a unique position using the advertising:  "You've tasted the German beer that's the most popular in America. Now taste the German beer that's the most popular in Germany."

## Finding your unoccupied position

- If a product is not going to be first, it then must find an unoccupied position in which it can be first.
- At a time when larger cars were popular, Volkswagen introduced the Beetle with the slogan "Think small.”
- Volkswagen was not the first small car, but they were the first to claim that position in the mind of the consumer.

## Other positioning examples

Other positions that firms successfully have claimed include:
- age (Geritol)
- high price (Mobil 1 synthetic engine lubricant)
- gender (Virginia Slims)
- time of day (Nyquil night-time cold remedy)
- place of distribution (L'eggs in supermarkets)
- quantity (Schaefer - "the one beer to have when you're having more than one.")

## Repositioning the competition

- Sometimes there are no unique positions to carve out.  In such cases, Ries and Trout suggest repositioning a competitor by convincing consumers to view the competitor in a different way.
- Tylenol successfully repositioned aspirin by running advertisements explaining the negative side effects of aspirin.
- Repositioning a competitor is different from comparative advertising. Comparative advertising seeks to convince the consumer that one brand is simply better than another. Consumers are not likely to be receptive to such a tactic.

## Repositioning Stolichnaya

- Consumers tend to perceive the origin of a product by its name rather than reading the label to find out where it really is made.
- Such was the case with vodka when most vodka brands sold in the U.S. were made in the U.S. but had Russian names.
- Stolichnaya Russian vodka successfully repositioned its Russian-sounding competitors by exposing the fact that they all actually were made in the U.S., and that Stolichnaya was made in Leningrad, Russia.

## Repositioning Pringles

- When Pringle's new-fangled potato chips were introduced, they quickly gained market share.
- However, Wise potato chips successfully repositioned Pringle's in the mind of consumers by listing some of Pringle's non-natural ingredients that sounded like harsh chemicals, even though they were not.
- Wise potato chips of course, contained only "Potatoes. Vegetable oil. Salt.“
- As a result of this advertising, Pringle's quickly lost market share, with consumers complaining that Pringle's tasted like cardboard, most likely as a consequence of their thinking about all those unnatural ingredients.

## Avis tries harder

- Consumers rank brands in their minds. If a brand is not number one, then to be successful it somehow must relate itself to the number one brand.
- A campaign that pretends that the market leader does not exist is likely to fail. Avis tried unsuccessfully for years to win customers, pretending that the number one Hertz did not exist. Finally, it began using the line, "Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars, so why go with us? We try harder."
- After the campaign, Avis quickly became profitable. Whether Avis actually tried harder was not relevant to their success. Rather, consumers finally were able to relate Avis to Hertz, which was number one in their minds. 

## Applying positioning

- Sun Tzu stated, "battles are won or lost before they are ever fought."
- The concept of positioning applies to products in the broadest sense.
- Services, your business itself, tourist destinations, countries, and even careers can benefit from a well-developed positioning strategy that focuses on a niche that is unoccupied in the mind of the consumer or decision-maker.

## To position your product or service

- Ask yourself, “How can I be the first to claim a unique position in the mind of my customer.”
- What exactly is my positioning message?
- Remember, your consumer's mind reacts by accepting only what is consistent with their prior knowledge or experience.
- Don’t try to change their mind, instead find a position that they already believe to be true or have trouble being in opposition to such as the “Clean Air Act.”

## Finding your niche

- Remember, you must own your niche and own it outright.  No one else can occupy your space.
- If you can’t own it, especially from a marketing expenditure outlay, then decrease the size of niche until you can.
- If somebody else occupies your chosen space try to reposition them.

## Finally, let’s consider your message

- Your positioning message is what you will consistently reinforce to your selected niche.
- The message should help your customer identify, understand, and remember your position.
- To be effective, your message needs to be short—usually under five words—three or less is better.
- You should also try to let go of the intangibles such as your product features and price points and speak to your customer’s emotions.  For example:  Just do it—Nike.

## To craft your message

- Begin by listing why your customers choose to do business with you rather than your competitors.
- Try to list about three to five reasons listed in the order of importance.
- Now, narrow down the key difference between your business and your competitors in a single word.

## Be very careful

- When you listed why your customers choose to do business with you, it is probably true that you included words like: quality, customer service, expertise, selection, or location.
- Repeat this to yourself:  These words represent boring, rational argument.  In fact, they are probably the exact words that your competitor would list as well.

## Avoiding rational logic

- When you appeal to rational thought you, in effect, create an argument in the customer’s mind.
- To solve this issue, try moving your message from the customer’s head to their heart.
- To do this you need to appeal to their emotions.

## An example of selling emotions

- A grass seed company tried an experiment.
- They took their seed and put it into two separate packages:
   1. One simply said Grass Seed and the price of $.99.
   2. The second was named Lawn Seed and showed a beautiful lawn flowing down toward a river.  The price was $3.99.
- Remember, the seed inside the packages was identical.  But nonetheless, the Lawn Seed outsold the grass seed by a factor of 4:1.
- People don’t want grass seed but rather the hope, feeling, and aspiration of having the beauty of that pictured lawn—and that’s really what they are paying for.

## Consider your message again

- Go back and review your positioning message and ask yourself, “Does it create boring, rational argument or does it sell emotional hope and aspiration?”
- Start by re-writing your message in a sentence and then whittle your message down to three words or less.
- Remember Nike didn’t say, “We have the highest quality shoes made through state-of-the-art processes of the best procured materials meaning they are long-lasting, durable, and offered at an excellent price point.”
- No, be very clear, they said: “Just do it.”

# Designing Products  & Services

## What is it that you sell?

- One of the first questions to ask yourself is what does your product do?
- Other questions that you should address are:
   1. What need is addressed by the product?
   2. What are its features and benefits?
   3. Who supplies the products or materials?
- Whether you make or resell a product, these questions are important to answer.

## Manufacturing a product

If you manufacture a product, the following questions need to be addressed:
- How is it produced?
- What materials and labor are required?
- How will its quality be measured and controlled?
- What is its technological lifespan?
- What research and development has been conducted and what still needs to be done?

## Selling a service

- Delivering a service can be quite different then manufacturing a product.
- Some questions to address may include:
   1. What services do you offer?
   2. How do they work?
   3. What materials or equipment is needed?
   4. What are your labor needs for these services?
   5. What are the steps in your service process?
   6. What benefit(s) do you provide customers?
   
## Intellectual property

- Intellectual property is any product of the human intellect has some value in the marketplace. 
- Intellectual property can include business strategies, images, ideas and concepts.
- In some cases it can be worth more to a business than tangible assets.
- For more information on intellectual property visit the World Intellectual Property Organization.

## For more information on intellectual property visit the World Intellectual Property Organization.

- An important issue that comes up when discussing intellectual property is how to protect it.  
- Protection can be obtained through a trademark, patent or copyright.
- For information on patents, trademarks and copyrights go to… 
   1. United States Patent and Trademark Organization
   2. United States Copyright Office

## Packaging your product

- After you have addressed questions about your product, you should then consider how you will package it?
- The primary function of packaging use to be to hold and protect the product.
- Today, however, packaging is becoming an increasingly important marketing tool.

## Designing the packaging

- Many decisions are needed about the packaging – size, shape, color, material, and label.
- Be sure that the packaging is consistent with the product you are offering.
- Run engineering, visual and consumer tests when developing the packaging.
- Also reevaluate the packaging frequently after it has been introduced into the market.
