## Step 1: Influence Their Perception

>“All our knowledge has its origin in our perceptions.”
>–Leonardo da Vinci

Nothing in this world has concrete meaning. 
At the end of the day, price is merely a perception. 
Nothing more. Nothing less.

## PRIME A SMALL MAGNITUDE

You can influence people’s memory for your price. 
When people compare your price to a reference price, you can influence them to pull a lower price into that comparison.

Why would people do that? Because our brain is lazy.

>“…price information about a product is unlikely to be coded into memory in terms of exact numerical digits but, rather, is coded spontaneously in more general magnitude terms (e.g., “low,” “high”). Thus the numerical price is susceptible to the influence of its original context when people attempt to reconstruct it later.”

With such a hazy memory, you can influence people to recall a smaller magnitude. 

How? Here are a some useful tactics.

## Tactic 1: Reduce the Left Digit By One

For the past few decades, marketers have used charm pricing — prices that end in 9, 99, or 95.

Charm pricing is most effective when the left digit changes. A one-cent difference between $3.80 and $3.79 won’t matter. However, a one-cent difference between $3.00 and $2.99 will make a huge difference.

Why is the left digit so important? Because it anchors the perceived magnitude.

Our brains encode numbers so quickly (and beyond consciousness) that we encode the size of a number before we finish reading it.

>“…while evaluating “2.99,” the magnitude encoding process starts as soon as our eyes encounter the digit “2.” Consequently, the encoded magnitude of $2.99 gets anchored on the leftmost digit (i.e., $2) and becomes significantly lower than the encoded magnitude of $3.00”

*Bonus Tip:* 
You could emphasize the new base digit by visually minimizing the digits after the decimal.

## Tactic 2: Choose Prices With Fewer Syllables

Don’t overlook the auditory version of your price. 
It may seem irrelevant, but syllabic length influences price perception

When we encounter stimuli with many syllables, we need more mental resources to process that stimuli. And that principle applies to numbers. If we expend a larger amount of mental resources to process a number, we falsely infer that the magnitude must be larger.

The flipside is more important: 
*people perceive prices to be smaller when they contain fewer syllables.*

*But! When I see a price, I don’t say it out loud. I just read it.*

Same here. But according to research…that doesn’t matter. 
When you read a price in written form, your brain nonconsciously encodes the auditory version. You don’t even need to verbalize the price in your mind — your brain encodes it either way.

Still skeptical?

Coulter et al. (2012) found a positive relationship between syllabic length and perceived magnitude. 
Even if two prices have the same written length (e.g., $27.82 vs. $28.16), people perceive the phonetically longer price to be higher in magnitude.

## Tactic 3: Display Prices in a Small Font Size

Your brain has a universal conceptualization of size. Thus, there’s a blurred overlap between VISUAL size and NUMERICAL size.

That’s why customers perceive your price to be smaller if you display your price in a smaller font size

In a layout, position larger elements around your price. Those elements will reinforce a smaller visual magnitude, which will reinforce a smaller numerical magnitude.

The reverse works for discounts. Since you want to maximize the size of discounts, you should display those numerals in a large font size.

## Tactic 4: Remove the Comma

Researchers found that removing commas (e.g., $1,499 vs. $1499) can make your price seem lower

Why does that happen? Although physical length plays a role, there’s another principle involved. We already discussed it. Can you think of it?

When you remove the comma, you reduce the phonetic length of your price:

- $1,499: One-thousand four hundred and ninety-nine (10 syllables)
- $1499: Fourteen ninety-nine (5 syllables)

## Tactic 5: Use Words That Are Related to a Small Magnitude

Be careful when choosing the language near your price. Certain words can taint people’s perception.

For example, Coulter and Coulter (2005) presented participants with various descriptions for an inline skate. Some descriptions emphasized a “Low Friction” benefit. Other descriptions emphasized a “High Performance” benefit.

Even though participants rated those benefits as equally important, participants were more favorable toward the price when the description contained “Low Friction.”

When you choose the language near your price, choose words that are congruent with a small magnitude (e.g., “low,” “small,” “tiny”).

## Tactic 6: Separate the Shipping and Handling

If you sell products online, you should usually separate shipping and handling fees.

With “partitioned pricing” (i.e., separating a price into multiple components), you anchor people on the base price, rather than the total cost. When people compare your price to a reference price, they’ll be more likely to pull your base price into the comparison.

Hossain and Morgan (2006) tested that possibility with eBay auctions. They set up auctions for music CDs, and they analyzed different bidding structures.

- Some auctions offered a low opening bid with a shipping cost (e.g., $0.01 with $3.99 shipping).
- Some auctions offered a higher opening bid without a shipping cost (e.g., $4 with free shipping).


In the end, auctions with low opening bids (plus shipping charges) attracted more bidders and generated more revenue.
