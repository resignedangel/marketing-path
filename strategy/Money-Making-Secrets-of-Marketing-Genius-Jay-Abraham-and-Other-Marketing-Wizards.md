## Growing your client base

It is not new clients, but old clients, that are the key to growth and profitability

Your client relationships are the number one asset to have. 

You can secure customer relations by:

1. **Keeping in touch** - whether it be by telephone, mail, or in person - all customers want to feel that they are special and that you take spaecial interest in seeing their needs.
2. **Providing post-purchase reassurance.** Each time a customer places an order with you, call haim a week after recieving your produst or service to see how it's going. This will ally any post-purchase dissonance. Benefits of post-purchase reassurance:
   - You allay any "post-purchase dissonance" (buyer's remorse) that may be festering in the mind of your customer, his family or associates.
   - You dramatically reduce, and perhaps eliminate, the refunds. Exchanges or costly service expenses that disenchantment always produces.
   - You make the customer more receptive to your next offer.
   - You develop a closer relationship with your customers and satisfy their cravings to be acknowledged.
   - You give yourself an opprtunity to recommend a buying strategy that includes continuous repurchasing
   - You get the chance to immediately "upsell" the customer to some more expensive product or service that you make available exclusively to them at a preferential price.
   - You can solicit a customer's sales referral
   - You can often turn the initial sale into a rebewable annual contract by adding more products or services at a discount.
   - You can explain the use of the product so it will be used more often and reordered sooner.
3. Giving your clients the **best deals and guarantees** that you possibly can get away with.
4. **Preferential pricing** - let your "old" customers in on the best deals first. Give them the opportunity to buy your sale items before the public does.
5. **Building rapport and trust.** Be as honest as you can be with your customers. People do business with ethical people they can trust.
