**The high-effort, high-impact** work reflects the strategy you’re deliberately deploying.

Everyone’s favorite quadrant is the **low-effort, high-impact stuff.** 

But when you continually pick the low-hanging fruit, the branches will stop growing, so this work dries up quickly as your product and team matures. 
Most startups are sensible enough to avoid the high-effort, low-impact work, so it’s the last quadrant that’s worth talking about.

It’s the low-effort, low-impact work that can kill you, because it’s so attractive. It feels rewarding and can solve a short term problem, but if you never eat anything of substance you’ll suffer.

This work is easy to justify because *“it only took 30 minutes”.* And when it achieves nothing useful, it’s easy to excuse because it “took us so little time”. This is not strategy – this is flapping. Do this enough times and you’ll grow a low impact team that doesn’t achieve anything.

**The default position for a smart team without a clear plan is to snack.**

When I see teams at startups rushing to copycat the latest feature of the day, or swapping *“Sign up now”* with *“Sign up for free”*, I’m always reminded of this lower left. Snacks. Even in their best case, these projects are low impact for the absolute majority of companies.

If you want to have a high impact team stay away from low impact work. 

>Eat, don’t snack.
